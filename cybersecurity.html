<p><strong>What is Cybersecurity?</strong></p>
    <p>Cybersecurity is a process of protecting various systems, networks and programs that contain private and sensitive data from the threat of attackers. The aim of these online attackers is to steal/damage important data relating to a range of entities from large corporations down to individuals surfing the web. BY implementing cybersecurity in various networks, it makes it difficult for attackers to breach and steal/damage sensitive data.
  </p>
    <p><strong>What does it do?</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</strong>
      <br>Over recent years, with the ever-growing market of technology around the world, cybersecurity has had to continue to grow with the expanding threat of security breaches around the world. There are three main areas of functionality that is surveyed by a cybersecurity system, these three parts include Targets, Threats and Preventive measures. The target of a cybersecurity system is to protect information and communication systems, data within these systems and online personnel. Security systems that can be implemented to protect these systems are things such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to monitor the inflow and outflow of web-traffic. Threats are any form of attack or theft of data from a system, these threats to data can be caused via online attackers but are also capable of happening in the real-world, such as a bit of hardware being stolen from a computer/network system. In order to stop these threats to ICT systems and data, the other main part of cybersecurity, Preventive measures, are used to stop these attacks from happening. Some of the biggest forms of preventive measures is to provide education to staff about surfing the web and distinguishing between phishing links and real links. Other physical measures, such as using locks on doors and restricting access to certain areas of a networked area can help reduce the risk of the physical network being damaged.
      <br><strong>What can be done now?</strong>
      <br>Currently, over 80% of businesses have been comprised my at least one successful cybersecurity attack within the last 12 months. The role of cybersecurity is prevent these attacks from successfully infiltrating any unauthorised system/network risking the possibility of data being stolen or that system being damaged. Ways that current cybersecurity systems protect these ICT systems is to educate staff, constantly back up on a regular basis , this data can be backed up to third party systems such as cloud services from amazon which creates an offsite, cloud save, which can be accessed anytime without the risk of losing data if a problem occurs in current location.
<br><strong>What is likely to be able to do be done soon? (Say in the next 3 years?)</strong>
<br>Due to the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers have had to work from home which brings along a lot of challengers for cyber security experts to solve. One of the biggest issues when working from home is that home networks may not be as secured to that of a business network, therefore there is a high chance of attackers trying to infiltrate one’s system to gain access to the greater network and therefore a high chance of success. To combat such attacks, the core future of cybersecurity will involve artificial intelligence to process and find preventative measures to common cybercrimes, such phishing scams, internet fraud, intellectual property infringements, etc.
<br><strong>What technological or other developments make this possible? </strong>
Future development of artificial intelligence is projected to be the core component in cybersecurity systems. AI will be able to quickly understand and reaction to a cyber threat faster than any other human could ever do and therefore may be able to prevent a attack before any data is stolen or any system is damaged. AI are more efficient and are more effective in the discovery and improvements to multiple vulnerabilities and potential data beaches within a system. Some of this has already been implemented in today’s technologies, for example, google uses machine learning and adaptive AI to filter through emails and other techniques such as deep learning, which allows for more independent adjustments of algorithms to tailor to the user’s needs. Furthermore, as more and more people use smart phones for there day-to-day activities such as banking, shopping and more, security is needed on these devices and so, further developments to secure these devices with things such as mobile VPNs and antivirus software are being rolled out to these devices.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is the likely impact?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>What is the potential impact of this development?</strong>
      <br>These developments will create many jobs for people that work and study within the IT industry, but there is still a great demand for these types of people currently as most artificial intelligence systems are still not fully functional or not fully equipped to tackle such sophisticated tasks.
      <br><strong>What is likely to change?</strong>
      <br>With AI introduced into cybersecurity systems, the ability to predict threats will be easier than ever because an ever-learning algorithm will be able to follow current trends that cybercriminals use to attack a certain system. The ability to maintain bots will be a game changer in the grand scheme of internet traffic, bots are used in most DDOS attacks to flood a network ultimately resulting in a crash, with the introduction of an AI, they can quickly and effectively identify bots to speed up internet traffic and reduce the number of DDOS attacks faced constantly by networks. However, using AI has its downsides, in order to build and maintain an AI system, businesses will have to invest a lot more resources to keep the system running.
    <strong>Which people will be most affected and how?</strong>
      <br>Business that hold personal information such as banks, insurance companies, etc, will all benefit from this development as this will most likely help improve the overall security of the already existing systems which will make it harder for attackers to breach and steal or damage data.
      <br><strong>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</strong>
      <br>Currently, machine learning does not affect my family or friends that much but in near future, it can. My friend is currently studying automotive engineering and when self-driving cars become more available to people, it can change how he operates such as designing new products and finding solutions that accommodate a self-driving car. Overall machine learning still has a lot of room for improvement, thus in near future will have an even bigger impact on business and the environment.
      <br><strong>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</strong>
      <br>Currently, career paths such as a security analyst and/or a security systems administrator are still required within business to monitor and maintain networks from being breached. However, in the future, when artificial intelligence is equipped to tackle these tasks, these jobs could be made redundant as AI will most likely be able to do the very tasks that these professions are required to do, more efficiently and effectively than any human could. Although some professions may be made redundant, others will grow in higher demand once AI become available, Penetration testing will be highly requested as AI only know what sort of things they can detect and prevent, so be having someone with a range of skills to expose the vulnerabilities within a system, this will help provide feedback to the network and those security software developers, to strengthen their security.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How will this affect you?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In your daily life, how will this affect you? </strong>
      <br>Will the increase reliability on our mobile devices for our most important and sensitive data, cyber threats are a real issue to the ill-informed and to those that lack awareness to common security issues. Phishing and trojan horse software are some of the biggest threats that many user are faced with so to prevent these attacks from happening, further developed security protocols are being released by major tech companies such as Apple and Android operating systems to keep us from ruining our devices and keeping our data safe.
      <br><strong>What will be different for you?</strong>
      <br>With the development of more complex security systems such as AI, understanding how these security systems work and what requirements these systems must have such as what administrative privileges they must gain access to, users will find it difficult to understand how their security system runs and how they can plan to upgrade or how they can improve their navigation of the internet to steer clear of potential intrusions which can damage the network.  
      <br><strong>How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </strong>
      <br>Artificial intelligence will greatly benefit those within a network as it provides security to all users of that network. However, there is a risk by using artificial intelligence to have control over a personal network, with the ability of anything technical potentially being hacked, if the security system were to be hacked, it could easily be able to steal all the private and sensitive data from all users within the network.
