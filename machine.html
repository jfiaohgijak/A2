    <p><strong>What is machine learning?</strong></p>
    <p>What is machine learning? Machine learning is another field in artificial intelligent and computer science, where the machine can mimic the intelligent of a human behaviour through the uses of data and algorithm. In fields such as data science, computer leaning is an important element as prediction and key insight can be uncover with an algorithm of a machine. With this insight application and business have an easier decision-making process. Machine learning process can be broken down into three parts.

<br><strong>1. A Decision process:</strong> A perdition or classification is produce using the learning algorithm of a machine. An estimate pattern will be made in the using the data that been stored previously.

<br><strong>2. An Error Function:</strong> To know if the prediction is accurate an error function is needed to evaluate the prediction. Example from the past can be used as a comparison to increase the accuracy of the model.

<br><strong>3. A Model Optimization Process:</strong> Optimization is where algorithms minimize the differences between the actual data and the prediction data. This helps the algorithms to predict more accurately on new data.
  </p>
    <p><strong>What does it do?</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>What state of the art of this new technology?</strong>
      <br>Machine learning have come a long way as it has expanded to many different industries and businesses in short amount of time, any many more companies adopting it. This can be seen with the study case “The state of Machine Learning in the Enterprise” showing that 49% of businesses want to explore or investigate using machine learning, while the other 51% supposably claimed to be early adopter and 15% are experience user. This data shows that machine learning is a growing trend among businesses and organization, meaning that information processing and analysis play an important for factor the 21st century business environment. While the state of machine learning is the most excited and robust right now, there is many challenges that come with it for the users and the researchers innovating in this arena. This just shows that the technology is still new and have many rooms for improvement.
      <br><strong>What can be done now?</strong>
      <br>Machine learning has broadened significantly, as many industry professionals had use it for many different applications. Some of the examples of how machine learning is being used several industries can be seen below:

<br><strong>●Financial Services:</strong> To improve their services and satisfaction, the financial services record every customer transaction and engagement to produces data. Using machine learning, they can analyse the pattern of their customer actions, ranging from their spending to saving and investing. This helps them to come up with financial advice and products.

<br><strong>●Retail:</strong> Online retailers rely heavily on machine learning to gather and leverage customer data to efficiently build up sales and satisfaction. This is done through gathering information and determining when and where to offers customer discounts, change products or revise pricing. Uber is a perfect example of revise pricing, by using the weather and traffic at the time to determine the pricing in real time. It also helps business to have a better understanding of the consumer demographic, by looking into trend across geographies, over various timespans. This helps them to narrow down and anticipate their customers.

<br><strong>●Healthcare:</strong> Medical diagnoses are the main function of machine learning in the medical field. An example would be detecting skin cancer, Stanford has a find a way to diagnosing skin cancer by using algorithm to learn the data that imaging fed into it. Computers are also being trained across the healthcare field to detect any abnormalities or potential issues. Improvement in algorithms can be seen across clinical trials and pharmaceutical. By using multiple sources and combining their data, identify success factors and potential issues simpler.
<br><strong>What is likely to be able to do be done soon?</strong>
<br>The future of machine learning is looking good as there many applications for it to be use. It expands across all field such as banking, information technology, media, the automotive industry, and quantum computing. Self-driving car seem to be more of a reality than dream. Big company like Tesla, Waymo and Honda are already developing and manufacturing semi-autonomous vehicles. With machine learning fully autonomous vehicles should be possible in a few years. With the help of machine learning, self-driving car can improve on their perception and navigation. This includes path planning, scene classification and obstacle detection.
<br>Other futures industries, such as healthcare and pharma are going to be greatly improve through techniques of machine learning to have better prediction and treatments of diseases. The old way of prediction for diseases does not take account for patience’s differentially such as weight, age, sex, etc. However, with the help of the technology it enables doctor to analyse patience on a wider range, leading to better results for prediction. Disease prediction is not the only thing that machine learning help within the health industry, they also help to make drug for treatment. In near future machine learning would be able to use algorithms to predict the impact of drug compound could have on patience. Machine learning would speed up this process in which more drugs would be available in the market quicker.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is the likely impact?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>What is the potential impact of this development?</strong>
      <br>As mentioned before machine learning assist in self-driving cars. As it is crucial for self-driving cars to be able to make quick unprogrammed decisions based on observed data. If self-driving vehicles become available, they will have a beneficial impact on the environment as most self-driving cars will be electric. This means that we can reduce our carbon emissions from cars and have more ‘sustainable’ resources. Machine learning also greatly impact the medical field, as diseases will be able to detect at a more incredible speed than human is capable of, it can also recommend any treatments that physician may overlook. With this improvement, human life expectancy will increase by getting treatment for the diseases at the early stage. The development can affect people of all ages.
      <br><strong>Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current jobs?</strong>
      <br>With a rise in machine learning in the job market, there will a rise in unemployment. This is due to computers being able every task from minor and inconvenience to hard complex calculations with little to nonhuman intervention. According to “World Economic Forum” automation displace 75 million jobs worldwide. Thus, gives the employer no reason to hire a team of employees to do the same task as the machine but must pay a hefty amount, while the machine can do it for free. However, this can also create new jobs as well, as often many machines will require a person to operate them. So, employers will look for people who will have the required skills to sustain in the market. While it may seem like machines are taking over the job market, the "World Economic Forum shows that AI can create more jobs than it will destroy, as the report shows that it can create 133 million jobs. Therefore, the long-term effect of machine learning is not as bad as people make it to be.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How will this affect you?</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</strong>
      <br>Nearly all industries have algorithm and data learning, this can affect how my future job operate. But overall machine learning doesn’t affect my daily life much besides other minors’ stuff such as checking the weather or using Google Maps and using Uber. Machine learning helps to calculate the price of the trip base on the traffic and demand at the time, this helps me to determine whether to get an uber at a certain time.
      <br><strong>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</strong>
      <br>Currently, machine learning does not affect my family or friends that much but in near future, it can. My friend is currently studying automotive engineering and when self-driving cars become more available to people, it can change how he operates such as designing new products and finding solutions that accommodate a self-driving car. Overall machine learning still has a lot of room for improvement, thus in near future will have an even bigger impact on business and the environment.
