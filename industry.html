</p>
<p><strong>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank terms of demand from employers? </strong>
  <br>The most wanted IT-specific skills are SQL, where Claire would need it for her security analyst role .JavaScript and Python seem to be the second wanted IT skill from employers and most the people from our group except Claire required some good knowledge in JavaScript. With 2946 jobs offer that required JavaScript. Next close to JavaScript is Microsoft windows with 2699 jobs posting and is needed for Oliver as a software developer. By employees obtaining these skills such as python and JavaScript programming, this can only boost their employability for which they can apply a different scope to a problem, which without off, would have resulted in different project solution that what would have been more efficient and effective. 
</p>
<p><strong>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </strong>
<br>According to the Burning Glass data employers want a person to have a communication skill the most with (44,367) jobs that required some sort of great communication skills. As a Web developer Tommy is required to have this general skill because he would need to effectively communicate with his customer to get a desire product. Matthew also requires good communication skill for IT administrator because it assists him to execute his duties and obligations such as planning and organising. Matthew also has the second highest general skill problem solving with (16,445) jobs posting. He would need to use his critical thinking skill to solve their client question or problems. They must have able to tack the problem from various angle using critical thinking. Close to problem solving skills we have organisational skills in 3rd place and writing skill in 4th place with both around (15,000-16,000) job posting. Claire would require both skills to be efficient with her job placing her third in demand. In 5th place is teamwork/collaboration where Tommy, Claire and Andy are required to have it for better work results. It seems like Oliver is place last in terms of general skills that is in demand from employers with research in 10th place, leadership in 11th place and mentoring in 13th place.

<strong>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</strong>
<br>Tommy: Web Developer
	<br>Looking at the data in burning glass technology, I found that the demand for web developer have 		decrease by a lot, from 1,696 jobs posting in 2017 to only 381 in 2018. However, this have not changed my opinion about changing my job as it has a very high earning potential and have a lot of opportunity for growth in near future, and is also very flexible.  Andy: Software Engineer
<br>
<br>Andy: Software Engineer
<br>	Software engineers/developers is very important for the IT technology, as the build the programs that people use every day. Jobs in software engineer has significantly increased from 2007-2012 growing about 31%. It is still currently in demand and will be as technology continues to develop.  It is also noted that the number one requirements job was looking for people who can understand the language Java.  My opinion has not change much as this is a field that is still in very high demand.  
<br>
<br>Matthew: IT Systems Administrator
<br>	An IT Administrator falls under the Systems Administrator category. In March of 2017, it was the 3rd least popular job title only leading IT support Engineer and an Architect. However, in March of 2018, climbed to the top 8 most popular IT title possibly because of the ever-changing systems and network that are required for day-to-day operations, admins that have a great understanding of the new systems and to find solutions to potential errors are rising in popularity. 
<br>
<br>Claire: Security Analyst
<br>	Although Cybersecurity Analyst didn’t appear on the top IT jobs, another Burning Glass Technologies
article describe cybersecurity jobs as crucial and in demand and the number of jobs available grew 94% from 2013 to 2021. It states that while cybersecurity is a very in-demand skill, many jobs only include it as a responsibility instead of it bring the whole job. My opinion about the cybersecurity analyst job hasn’t changed much after viewing the data, since the role and demand is the same as I previously understood it to be.
<br>
 <br>Oliver: Software Developer
	<br>Game developers fall under the job title of software developer and are more specialised in creating video games. In May 2017, software developer was a very popular job position, ranking second. However, in the more recent February 2018 and March 2018, the popularity of software developers has dropped drastically. Since game development is a specific part of software development which is already low on demand, I think I might opt for software development in general.
