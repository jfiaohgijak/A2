<p><strong>What does it do?
<br>What is the state of the art of this new technology?  </strong></p>
    <p>Automated devices can be dated back to the ancient Greeks and Roman days as automated toys were built for religious ceremonies. However, the first robot to be created was in the early 1950s by George C. Devol. It was named “the Unimate” and was designed to do simple tasks repeatedly such as grabbing and lifting objects.  Nowadays robotics combines many diverse types of technologies to do one task.
      <br>Robotics is the use of machines for tasks that are normally done by humans. Robotics are often found in the manufacturing industry but can also be found in many more industries as technology develops. Robots are designed to do tasks that are too dangerous for humans and can do the tasks repetitively without error. Some tasks performed by robots are:
      <br>Wielding
      <br>Fly via drones
      <br>Preparing medicines
      <br>Creating music
      <br>Perform operations on patient
      <br>Manufacturing supplies
      <br>Heavy Lifting
      <br>Working with dangerous chemicals
      <br>There 3 main components to a robot, the controller, mechanicals parts and sensors. Each one of these components can make up vastly distinct types of robots. A robot can either be controlled by a human or a computer program.
  </p>

    <p>
      <br><strong>What can be done now?</strong></p>
      <p>
      <br>As the world develops more sophisticated robots, robots will become more self-sufficient and therefore will require less user inputs to guide the robot. Some interesting ideas for robots that are currently being used today are restaurants that are fully operated by robots. There are different types of robots to do different tasks which include making the food, cleaners, receptionists, and drink servers. These restaurants that are fully automated claim that they save money by using these robots because they are reducing accidents they occur in a restaurant.
      <br>Another industry and idea robots are being used for is in the health department. Robots are being created to help distribute medication to patients, perform surgery, or help out doctors. In the surgery room, doctors can control the robots to conduct the surgery, becoming an extension to the doctor’s arm but with more precision. This allows the doctors to make more precise incisions, and less mistakes can be made. Hospital robots help out with reception and are the result of the corona virus happening. Hospital robots allow for contactless delivery of medicine and food. They are also able to help sanitise a room removing any potential harmful pathogens.</p>
<p><br><strong>What is likely to be able to do be done soon? (Say in the next 3 years?)</strong></p>
<p><br>By creating robots which can do tasks such as cleaning, transportation, and delivery the robotics industry is expected to be worth $260 billion by 2030. Even though robots have been around for many years, in the last few decades it has grown exponentially in the uses it is used for. For example, the military have started adopting the worldwide use of drones as surveillance and UAVs as a weapon. In the security industry, robots can be used to recognise suspicious activities which then relays it to law enforcement officers in the area allowing for a quick response to the scene. Drones may also be developed to send live footage to law enforcement so they can get a bird eye view of the area without using a helicopter.  Robots to help people with their daily lives at home are starting to become popular. For example, Roomba a vacuum cleaning robot will vacuum the floor without the help of the user or the google nest hub which can help control various parts of the house with tasks such as turning the lights on and off, providing for a better convenience to the user.</p>
<p><br><strong>What technological or other developments make this possible? </strong></p>
<p>A big technology that will massively improve robots is the use of machine learning technology to allow the robots to make decisions based on their programs. There are 5 main types of machine learning applications for robots:
<br>Computer Vision:
<br>Computer vision refers to the robot being able to detect objects in the real world and process the physical data.
<br>Imitation Learning:
<br>Imitation learning refers to the robot being able to learn by copying the tasks and actions that are shown to them.
<br>Self-Supervised Learning:
<br>Self-Supervised Learning is the robot being able to learn from data that is given to them and then process and predict likely outcomes that may happen.
<br>Assistive and Medical Technologies:
<br>Assistive and Medical machine learning can help with learning disabilities or impairment and can help them with their work via reading or writing.
<br>Multi-Agent Learning:
<br>This technology consists of using multiple interactions to help the robots learn and 	reinforce their data.
<br>This technology will greatly improve robots as robots will require less user inputs and instead become self-automated. This also will improve daily lives as robots with machine learning in the future can help a person wake up and make their food while they get ready by learning their routine.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is the likely impact?
    <br>What is the potential impact of this development?</strong></p>
      <p><br>The potential impact of the development of robots is that productivity will increase due to them being able to do tasks repetitively without stopping for a break. This will be the beginning to help reshape supply chains all over the world. Robots are also able to reduce health risk jobs as they can take over for humans saving time and money. Overall improvement to robotic invention will help improve the world significantly.</p>
      <p><br><strong>What is likely to change?</strong></p>
      <p><br>When machine learning technology becomes more widely used and explored, we can expect a new revolution of robots being added into every workplace to do tasks that are tedious to do. Companies will also need more people to help with the increase of products being produced. This may include people who can understand how the robots work and then do the required task of their job. Robots will also improve every other sector in any capacity it can whether it be small tasks or large operations that are high risks, robots will improve the production. This also means there will be less need for managers to manage people and instead the workplace will need to hire people who can understand how robots' function to do their specific tasks.</p>
    <p><strong>Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</strong></p>
      <p><br>The traditional assembly line workers will be replaced by robots who will be able to do the job more efficiently and with increased productivity due to it being able to repeatedly do the same tasks repeatedly. Other jobs that may be affected by robots are taxi drivers, bus drivers or any other transport drivers. There has been an increase in production of self-sufficient cars which do not require any user input to drive the car which can be seen by Tesla. Though the technology is still not perfected and is still in the works, but in the future, you can expect transport drivers to lose their jobs to robots.</p>
      <p><br><strong>How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </strong></p>
      <p><br>If robots were to become part of the norm for society, then I can see myself using robots to increase the convenience in my own household. This is by adding robots who can cook breakfast, get me up or pick my clothes to wear for the day. Robots will also allow for a consistent routine and as someone who finds it difficult to get out of bed, having robots will help with my mornings. Robotic invention will continue to benefit society due to its diverse range of functions engineers can build for the people. Robots in a family setting can be used to monitor babies/younger children while the parents can go to work. This relieves the older sibling of having to look after their younger siblings and instead focus on studying or enjoying their hobbies.
