    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Analysis</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><strong>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?  </strong>
<br>The IT professional is Paul Rottura and he a senior service desk analyst working at Ramsay Health Care. Rottura provides level 1,2 and 3 technical supports to the staff members, members of the corporate office and the patients that stay at the hospital. In addition to level 1 and 2 technical supports, Rottura also helps people with general computer-related issues.  

<br><strong>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are the other IT professionals? Clients? Investors?  The public? </strong> 
<br>Paul Rottura interacts with the staff at Ramsay Health Care, members of the corporate office and patients as he provides them with level 1, 2 and 3 technical supports. He also works with average everyday people and help them with general computer related issues. Rottura’s job has a balance of individual work and group work. There will be tasks and incidents that he will work on his own and will times where he will work on projects alongside colleagues and other service desk analyst. He will also work directly with executive staffs for the hospitals, members of infrastructure network teams and other project teams within Ramsay Health Care. Rottura will work with venders and businesses and help them with issues and repairs involving hardware and software.   

<br><strong>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?  </strong>
<br>At work Paul Rottura spent most of his with troubleshooting and identifying client/customer problems. When Paul is helping a client, he would need to gather a lot of information about his client, because the client usually presents a very vague problem, and it is up to Paul to find out what that specific problem is to be able to help the client. Depending on the issue Paul can also spend a lot of time on the issue as well, but generally Paul would spend most of his time understanding what the issue is. To identify the problem of his client, he would need to list all the potential problems that his client could possibly have and then eliminate the one he thinks is the problem and then narrow it down to a few selections he thinks is the problem.   
<br><strong> What aspect of their position is most challenging? </strong>
<br>When Paul first started his job, he found that trying to improve his troubleshooting was the most challenging. Where he must learn and understand how computers and systems work and interact. As time goes on, he will gain more experience, so the learning part becomes easier. However, when he changes jobs, the challenge now is to adapt his past experiences to the specific need of the company. But as a manager now he has found that identifying the weaknesses and strengths of his team is the most challenging for him. He must identify the weaknesses and strengths so that he can develop strategies that could help his team to improve upon their troubleshooting skills. In some of the teams that he works with people shared ideas, collaborated, and help each other else. However, sometimes he works with a team where a person would have a certain knowledge about a process and a product, but they are not willing to communicate. This is known as “knowledge silo”, which can cause many problems within the teams.
