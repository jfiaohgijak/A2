<p><strong>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? 
</strong></p>
    <p>Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that can sense and navigate the environment and are able to act and function independently without being controlled and operated by a human. This is achieved through complex programming and algorithms. The vehicle uses sensors and machine learning systems to map out the surrounding environment. There are many different types of sensors such as, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, radar sensors, ultrasonic sensors and video cameras. According to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), there are currently 6 levels of automation of a vehicle, from level 0 which means a vehicle has no automation and a human must control it and perform all tasks manually, to level 5 which means a vehicle is fully automated and can perform all tasks under any conditions without the presence of a human.  
<br>The level that autonomous vehicles are currently at is level 2 which means that a vehicle can drive, accelerate, break and steer independently, however there must be always a person in the driver’s seat to monitor the conditions and environment and take back control in certain situations. There are many models of level 2 autonomous vehicles such as the 2022 Honda Civic and the Cadillac Super Cruise.  
<br>There are many problems and challenges concerning the current levels of autonomous vehicles. At level 2, vehicles are incapable of detecting the road ends and road signs and markings that have worn out by weather or been tampered with, merging lanes that are not part of the map, and many other detail and nuances of the road which only can be navigated through a human’s experiences and intuition, as right now the road especially a busy one is too chaotic and unpredictable for an AI to understand. Another challenge in level 2 autonomous vehicles is the fact that the driver must always concentrate to control the vehicle when it is faced with an exception on the road that it cannot detect. Human beings are prone to error and travelling in a self-driving car may cause comfort or boredom which may distract the driver. For instance, a car may encounter a merging lane on a highway that it is incapable of detecting and thus stopping, which is dangerous for the human driver if they are too slow to react.  
<br>GM promised the development of self-driving cars by the 1970s and then again in 2018 and Elon Musk said that Tesla would have self-driving cars by 2018. The development of autonomous vehicles proves to be a much more challenging and ambitious goal than many would believe and Kelly Funkhauser, a researcher who tests self-driving technology for Consumer Reports, that fully autonomous vehicles will not be available for the public to be driven safely until 2050.  
<br>What may be possible in the next three years is a level 3 autonomous vehicle which means it is able to form decisions independently based on the environment and scanning and detecting the surroundings. Because of this, it is capable of detecting road ends, divided highways, merging lanes etc. However, this level of automation can only operate in specific conditions and areas. For example, the roads of a suburb can be programmed into the vehicle, and so that vehicle can only drive in that suburb and nowhere else. Level 3 automation still requires a human driver to stay concentrated in certain situations where the surrounding environment can change such as during a snowstorm. There are models of cars in development that are advertised to have level 3 automation which mean that level 3 automation may be possible in the next 3 years.

    <p><strong>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? </strong></p>
      <p>If level 5 autonomous vehicles were successfully developed and available to the public, then it would make a substantial impact on the people and the world. The types of people who will be most affected by the development of level 5 autonomous vehicles are most likely the elderly and the physically disabled as they will be able to gain more independence. The elderly can have poor memory and eyesight, low mental and physical stamina, and slow cognition and reaction time. The physically disabled may lack certain appendages or body parts, lack flexibility and dexterity, or be restricted in certain movements of their body. These disadvantages may prevent these groups of people from driving non autonomous vehicles and thus may prevent them from travelling.

These disadvantages may prevent these groups of people from driving non autonomous vehicles and thus may prevent them from travelling. 
      <br>One of the biggest impacts of a successful level 5 autonomous vehicle will be on road safety. Most deaths that occur on the road are due to human errors. People can be reckless when driving, such as speeding, multitasking, distracted or being under the influence. According to the National Transportation and Safety Board in the US, 94% of road accidents are due to human error, errors that can be less likely for a machine to make.  
      <br>If road accidents decrease, then this may affect the business of insurance companies. Jobs that require human workers such as taxi, Uber and public transit drivers may become redundant with the development of autonomous vehicles as it is cheaper in the long term because there are less workers to pay.

    <p><strong>How will this affect you?  </strong>
    For the average University student, autonomous vehicles would make travelling more convenient. Depending on traffic, in most scenarios, travelling by car is faster than travelling by public transport. Self-driving cars will not only decrease traffic, but also make themselves more available to people such as University students. For example, a student who lives outside the city and with their parents. Their parents will take their car to work and thus the student must take public transport to travel to the city to study which may take hours. If fully autonomous vehicles were used, then after the parents have been driven to work, the vehicle can drive itself back home and be available to the student to drive to university. Location of living space can also be affected for students who have moved out of their parent’s house. The average student does not make a lot of money, and if their university is in the city, this could be problematic because the cost-of-living space usually increases the closer it is to the city. With autonomous vehicles, students can afford to live further away from the city. Students will become more independent as they will have more agency on where and how they will live and travel, especially for those who have yet to learn how to drive and those who are incapable of driving. Autonomous vehicles can also improve interconnectivity between family and friends as travelling becomes more convenient.
