    <p><strong>What went well?</strong>
      <br>What I found our team did really well in was communication and organisation. The very first thing we did as a group was to divide each task to each week and then we would assign each task to a person. This was very helpful to me as each person would know what they are doing and there would be a deadline for each week which motivate us to finish our work faster. Another thing I feels like we did very well as a group was communicating which each other, for an example if one of us couldn’t make it to a meeting we would let the rest of the member know, or if one of us would need help or clarification they would reach out.
      <br><strong>What could be imporved?</strong>
      <br>Overall, as a group I feel like we did pretty well but what can be improved is arranging a time where everyone is free to do a meeting. It was difficult finding a time where everyone was able to be in the meeting at the same time.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong>
      <br>One thing I found surprising was that we were very productive each meeting we were in and it just not a quick 3-minute meeting where everyone just joins for the sake of joining. Our meetings would usually for 10-minutes+ and during that meeting we would check up on everyone and where are they up or do they need any help. We would also discuss what will be doing next week etc.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong>
      <br>I have learned that by planning as a group would make everything easier. By planning a head everyone in the group were able to effectively coordinate our work for efficient task completion. Teamwork is also another big factor, if everyone gets along well then, we can communicate with each other better.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong>
      <br>Our group did well in terms of communication and allocation of tasks. We allocated different task to all the group members which ensures that everyone knew what they had to do. Our meetings were very effective on keeping everyone accountable, keeping track of both individual member’s and the overall group’s progress and keeping everyone up to date on information.  
      <br><strong>What could be imporved?</strong>
      <br>I feel like we could improve on organising the time of meetings as some of the times and dates are very inconvenient and due to that, we have some meetings where not all our group members are present. Next time, we should have more members in our group so that the work is more divided making it easier to complete within a set timeframe. For example, due to having few members, each IT technology section was allocated to one person, while other groups with more members were able to allocate different parts of each IT technology section to each person.  
      <br><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong>
      <br>One thing surprising is how short and to the point each meeting were. I was expecting 30-minute meetings where we discuss in depth what has been done, but instead we have 10–15-minute meetings that were concise and explained to everyone what they need to know. I think this is better than a longer and more in-depth meeting.   
      <br><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong>
      <br>One thing I have learned from about the groups is that it is more stressful than individual work because what you do affects everyone. I was struggling to do my part and that made me stress a lot because I did not want to be a detriment to the group.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong>
      <br>Throughout the duration of the assignment, I believe that the best thing that went well was the constant communication on a range of different platforms; Facebook, Teams, etc. By always communicating, it keeps everyone informed how much progress we all made together as a collective, and the ability to ask for help if we are finding anything difficult. 
      <br><strong>What could be imporved?</strong>
      <br>Although we created a work plan at the beginning of the assessment process, we didn’t really stick to it and a lot of tasks that needed to be completed earlier, weren’t done until the final few weeks. 
      <br><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong>
      <br>It was surprising to be able to work together on the website html, however, this came with some issues, that being it is only a peer-to-peer network, so if the main holder of the repository was not online, then the website could not be created.   
      <br><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong>
      <br>One thing that I have learned within this group is that everyone is very happy to lend a hand, if need be, and that everyone can come up to a certain compromise or better solution to complete a task.

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Claire</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong>
      <br>I thought we were quite good at communicating because we had meeting at around 10pm so it was easier to have everyone there. It also meant that they would stay concise and we had meetings quite regularly. Fortunately, everyone did the work they said they would do in the time frame they said they would so planning and trusting that we would be able to stick to that plan as much as possible was doable.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong>
      <br>Although we planned what each person would do week-by-week at the start of the assignment, it changed quite a bit. For example the IT Work interview was originally planned to be completed in week 7 but didn’t get conducted until late week 8. 
      <br><strong>What could be imporved?</strong>
      <br>Sometimes we forgot about meetings so next time I should probably set alarms or reminders when we have a meeting. As stated earlier, the rough schedule ended up being different to what actually happened and since I was doing some of the sections that relied on other parts such as Ideal Jobs and Team Profile,  waiting for things such as Assignment 1 results delayed my ability to start early.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong>
      <br>I have learned that communication and planning what people will do and when they will do it is very helpful and makes a big project seem more doable.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong>
      <br>Our group thrived on being able to communicate well and as a result organise tasks for each person to do in the first week of being together. This allowed all of us to understand our roles in the team and if changes needed to occur, we were able to change them by discussing them in our meetings.  
      <br><strong>What could be imporved?</strong>
      <br>Things that would need to be improve as a group is sticking to the plan and try to complete certain tasks in the week that it was set. This is to ensure that we finish our assignment earlier and not towards the date of submission.  
      <br><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong>
      <br>One surprising thing about our group is how well we meshed when we had group meetings. We were able to communicate the things that we needed to do, and our discussions were simple and to the point allowing us to easily understand each other.  
      <br><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong>
      <br>One thing I have learnt in this group is that organising work for everyone evenly is very important as it allows for more people to efficiently work without doubling up on a task. This also meant that people could teach their other group members what they are doing and both parties can learn about what to do in a short time.
