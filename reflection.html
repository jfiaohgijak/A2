    <p><strong>What went well?</strong>
      <br>What I found our team did really well in was communication and organisation. The very first thing we did as a group was to divide each task to each week and then we would assign each task to a person. This was very helpful to me as each person would know what they are doing and there would be a deadline for each week which motivate us to finish our work faster. Another thing I feels like we did very well as a group was communicating which each other, for an example if one of us couldn’t make it to a meeting we would let the rest of the member know, or if one of us would need help or clarification they would reach out.
      <br><strong>What could be imporved?</strong>
      <br>Overall, as a group I feel like we did pretty well but what can be improved is arranging a time where everyone is free to do a meeting. It was difficult finding a time where everyone was able to be in the meeting at the same time.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong>
      <br>One thing I found surprising was that we were very productive each meeting we were in and it just not a quick 3-minute meeting where everyone just joins for the sake of joining. Our meetings would usually for 10-minutes+ and during that meeting we would check up on everyone and where are they up or do they need any help. We would also discuss what will be doing next week etc.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong>
      <br>I have learned that by planning as a group would make everything easier. By planning a head everyone in the group were able to effectively coordinate our work for efficient task completion. Teamwork is also another big factor, if everyone gets along well then, we can communicate with each other better.
