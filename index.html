    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Overview</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>Many people love traveling with friends or family, however, sometimes they are not available, so you must travel by yourself. Traveling by yourself can often be very overwhelming as there are many factors that you need to consider such as money, hotel, and much more. Therefore, we want to make an application that will help the user traveling for the first time or by themselves more enjoyable. This application will consist of programs that will help the user find the cheapest flight to and from their destination and help them to find an affordable place to stay at. The application can also help the user to find fun and affordable activities, it can also recommend foods based on where you are. The application will also share useful information such as the culture and the dos and don'ts when visiting another country to avoid the risk of offending anyone.

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Motivation</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>This project idea came to Tommy when he was planning a road trip with my mates last year and he noticed how hard it was, especially when everything is not on one application. They had searched the web for hours until they found a decent and affordable hotel to stay at and they then spent another hour finding a ticket that was cheap as well. Everything was very disorganized, so it was very overwhelming for them. With this application, everything will be in one place, so it is much easier to organize. There are also a lot of people out there who want to travel by themselves but are too scared because of the process and the planning of it, hopefully, this app will encourage them to do it and make the process easier.

<br>There is a large market for this app because a lot of travellers are young, inexperienced, alone, or in a rush. This app will make travelling more accessible to everyone, not only those who are extremely outgoing, organised, and have ample time to plan.
    </p>

  <div class="w3-container" id="services" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Description</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>This app is a travel guide that will help the user’s planning experience easier. When the user first opens the app, it will require them to either login or sign up. If the user does not already have an account, it will ask them to make a profile by filling in their details. During the process of making their profile, they will need to verify their ID as well to make sure the user is over 18. Once the user is done making a profile it will take them to the homepage where they can start using the app. Within the app, the user can change their details by clicking on ‘My Profile’ at the top of the application.
<br>
<br>On the homepage, the user will find information and news from a different country around the world. When the user scrolls down they will see different events that are happening soon. This will consist of the date and the location of where it is happening. In the top left corner, there will be an option where the user can open and see 5 different sections. First is the ‘homepage’ which is where they initially start. The second section will be ‘flights,’ where it will show the current cheapest ticket around the world. In the third section, there will be a ‘local tip’ from different users around the world, for example, “watch out for the pickpocket in this area” or “try this food at this restaurant”. There would be another section where you submit your experience or tips to other users. In this section you would be able to find 3 options, you can either post a picture or a video and then post a text underneath it. In the fifth section, it will be 'thing to do', where it shows users different activities around the world, such as snowboarding in this location or sightseeing in this location. Lastly, there will be an option underneath where the user can put feedback on how the application can be improved.
<br>
<br>When the user wants to start planning their trip, they must press the plus icon in the top right of the application. After that the application would ask the user to put in the location they are headed, then they would need to put in how many people they are traveling with. This will help the program generate the cheapest hotel and flight tickets based on how many people are going. Next, they would choose plane ticket and hotels. After they process their payment, the user will be taken to a new page. This page will contain upcoming events that are happening near the location they are traveling to, it also contains information about the location they are traveling to, such as foods to try out around the areas and places to visit.
<br>
<br>If the user has a location to visit in mind but is yet to decide, they can choose to filter the results to show similar locations. This will allow travellers to see lesser-known places, and it could help increase tourism to those areas.

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Tools & Technology</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>Would need a computer that is strong enough to run programs such as JavaScript, and Quixy. Quixy will allow us to mind map what the application will look like, and JavaScript will help us build the program itself. We will also need a book and pen to design a mock-up of the application. It will also be important to have some users test the app and give feedback. Another technology that can be used to, would be sharing data from a database such as google maps to implement a map which will show the directions for the user to take in order to arrive at the location.

  <div class="w3-container" id="services" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Skills Required</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>Knowledge of front-end coding for designing and developing an app is required. Also need to know how to operate programs such as Quixy. Having great teamwork, communication and problem-solving skills will also be important as most of the time you will be working in a team. While getting programming software is easy because RMIT will provide them to you, obtaining the skills to operate these programs will be time-consuming, but it will be worth it because you will gain valuable and in-demand skills. Teamwork and communication skills can be obtained through doing group activities in class. Furthermore, by obtaining database skills and understanding how to use programs like Bigtable, (developed and used by Google) this can further enhance the usability of the map within the program and potentially making future tasks such as rolling out updates, fixing bug issues, etc, a much easier process.

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Outcome</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>If the project is successful, the outcome would be that people will have a more enjoyable experience planning their trip and saving their money at the same time. So, when people plan their first trip it will not be as overwhelmed as all the information, they need will be organized into one spot. Not only that they would also know what activities to do in the areas as the application would recommend them. This will encourage people to go on trips more and experience diverse types of culture.

<br>The quality of the users’ travel experience will be improved because they will be able to enjoy the experience and be in the moment more without having to stress as much about planning. It will also make travelling more accessible to many people who may have been too nervous to go otherwise, opening them to a literal world of possibilities.
