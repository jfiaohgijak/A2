      Claire completed year 12 in 2021 and her interest in IT as a career began around year 10 and 11 when she did some cybersecurity and coding courses in her free time during lockdown instead of paying attention in classes. Despite this limited knowledge, she has no other IT experience so her interest in perusing a career in cybersecurity may change as she learns more.  </p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Test Results Analysis</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>
      Tommy and Oliver scored the same result of ENTP-T, and Andy and Claire received similar results of INTJ-A and INTJ – T respectively which are both Architects. Matthew was the only one out of the group who scored Protagonist (ENFJ-A). 
<br>The group members were split as close to 50/50 as possible (since we are a group of 5) in the ‘introverted’ (2)/’extroverted’ (3), ‘judgers (3)’/’perceivers (2)’, and ‘assertive’ (2)/’turbulent’ (3) categories. All members of the group were judged as being ‘intuitive’ and Matthew was the only one who was ‘feeling’ as opposed to ‘thinking’. 
<br>If the results are interpreted and a connection to real life is to be made, these results suggest that since Andy and Matthew were judged to be ‘assertive’, they may take the lead in meetings, Matthew may be the only one who considers others’ feeling when making decisions while everyone else may be the only ones to “make decisions with [their] head and want to be fair” (Myers-Briggs, 2022). 
 <br>
<br>Of those who completed a learning style test, Claire is a tactile learner while Andy is an auditory learner, Tommy is an auditory and visual learner and Matthew is a visual learner. This suggests that since both Tommy and Andy are auditory learners, spoken information from things such as meetings and conversations may be more meaningful to them, but since Tommy is a visual learner as well and Matthew is a visual learner, they may get more from reading the information.  
<br>Matthew has the role of ‘diplomat’ and strategy of ‘people mastery’ while Oliver has the role of ‘analyst’ and the strategy of ‘social engagement’. This suggests that Matthew may be good at organising the group with good people skills, while Oliver may be good at being impartial and hard working. 
Claire and Andy completed the ‘Big Five’ personality test, and Andy’s biggest feature was agreeability while Claire scored highest in intellect/imagination. This could suggest that Claire may be useful in making things such as the website since it may involve imagination. 
 <br>
<br>Overall, most of the group were shown to be quite analytical and objective with weaker people-skills other than Matthew who scored highly in leadership and people-skills as he received the ‘front-line leader’ result in his leadership style test, contributing to the pattern of good emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills shown throughout his test results. The results suggested that Matthew may be good a leading the group when it comes to meetings and communication. </p>
