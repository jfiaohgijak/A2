      Claire completed year 12 in 2021 and her interest in IT as a career began around year 10 and 11 when she did some cybersecurity and coding courses in her free time during lockdown instead of paying attention in classes. Despite this limited knowledge, she has no other IT experience so her interest in perusing a career in cybersecurity may change as she learns more.  </p>
